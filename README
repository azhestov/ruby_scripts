nginx_parslog.rb is simple tool for calculate HTTP 200 response time
by percentile. Before starting - look at you nginx log format and
remember field number for $status and $request_time. Fields
numbering starts from zero.

If you not sure, just start nginx_parslog with filename of your log
and follow simple menus
 
Usage:
nginx_parslog.rb log_filename [200 position] [time position]

Output example:
$./nginx_parslog.rb ../acc.log 5 9

Total count of HTTP200 is - 7403 from 7793 total.

95% percentile is 1.251 msec
75% percentile is 0.654 msec
50% percentile is 0.301 msec
25% percentile is 0.054 msec

Max response time is 1.422 msec

ToDo: 
zipped log reading
simple output for external scripts
opimization for big logs
read from stream
